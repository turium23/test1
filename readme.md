## üìç Overview

The code repository consists of two distinct code bases. The first code script provides functionality for managing employee data and generating reports based on this data. It includes classes for different types of employees (such as managers and assistants), a class for generating reports, and functions for adding/removing employees, finding employees, getting employees by role, and generating reports. This project aims to provide a framework for efficient employee data management and automated report generation.The second code script focuses on data processing, statistical calculations, and data manipulation. It includes functions for processing input data, calculating statistics, and manipulating data. Additionally, it encapsulates a helper class with utility methods. This project aims to provide a set of tools for effective data analysis and manipulation.

| [main.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\main.py)               | This code script consists of several classes and functions that aim to provide functionality for managing employee data and generating reports based on this data. The main classes include Employee, ManagerEmployee, AssistantEmployee, and ReportGenerator, while the main functions include add_employee, remove_employee, find_employee, get_employees_by_role, and generate_report.1. Employee Class: This class represents a generic employee with attributes such as name, age, and salary. It consists of a constructor to initialize these attributes and getter methods to retrieve the employee's information.2. ManagerEmployee Class: This class inherits from the Employee class and represents a manager employee. It introduces an additional attribute called subordinates, which stores a list of employees that report to the manager. It includes setter and getter methods for managing this list.3. AssistantEmployee Class: This class inherits from the Employee class and represents an assistant employee. It introduces an additional attribute called supervisor, which stores the manager employee that the assistant reports to. It includes setter and getter methods for managing this relationship.4. ReportGenerator Class: This class is responsible for generating reports based on the employee data. It includes a constructor that takes a list of employees as input and getter methods for retrieving the different types of reports.5. add_employee Function: This function takes an employee object as input and adds it to the list of employees stored in memory.6. remove_employee Function: This function takes an employee object as input and removes it from the list of employees if it exists.7. find_employee Function: This function takes an employee name as input and returns the employee object if found, or None if not found.8. get_employees_by_role Function: This function takes an employee role as input and returns a list of employee objects that match that role.9. generate_report Function: This function takes a report type as input (e.g.,'salary') and generates a report based on the employee data. The specific logic for each type of report is implemented within this function.Overall, this code script provides a framework for managing employee data and generating reports based on this data, utilizing classes and functions to ensure modular and organized code structure. |

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the project repository. This creates a copy of the project on your account that you can modify without affecting the original project.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using a Git client like Git or GitHub Desktop.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-feature-branch` or `bugfix-issue-123`).
```sh
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```
4. Make changes to the project's codebase.
5. Commit your changes to your local branch with a clear commit message that explains the changes you've made.
```sh
git commit -m 'Implemented new feature.'
```
6. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command
```sh
git push origin new-feature-branch
```
7. Create a new pull request to the original project repository. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made and why they're necessary.
The project maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback or merge them into the main branch.
