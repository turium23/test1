| [main.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\main.py)               | Code Script SummaryThis script contains a collection of functions and classes for a software application. It provides various functionalities for managing and manipulating data.## Class: DataManagerThe DataManager class handles the storage and retrieval of data. It provides methods for loading data from files, querying data, and saving data to files.### Method: load_data(file_path)This method loads data from a specified file path. It reads the contents of the file and returns the data.### Method: save_data(file_path, data)This method saves the provided data to the specified file path. It writes the data to the file.### Method: query_data(data, query)This method performs a query on the provided data. It takes a query as input and returns a filtered subset of the data that matches the query.---## Function: calculate_average(numbers)This function calculates the average of a list of numbers. It takes in a list of numbers as input and returns the average.### Parameters:-numbers (list): A list of numbers### Returns:-average (float): The average of the numbers---## Function: generate_report(data)This function generates a report based on the provided data. It takes in a dictionary containing data and formats it into a readable report.### Parameters:-data (dict): A dictionary containing data### Returns:-report (str): A formatted report---## Function: validate_input(input_string, validation_rule)This function validates user input against a specified validation rule. It takes in the user input and a validation rule as input and returns True if the input is valid, False otherwise.### Parameters:-input_string (str): The user input-validation_rule (str): The validation rule to be followed### Returns:-is_valid (bool): True if input is valid, False otherwise                                                                                                              |
| [autodoc.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\autodoc.py) | Code Script Summary:This code script is designed to efficiently perform various operations and function calls with the help of different classes and functions. Below, you'll find a description for each function and class used in the script.---### Function Descriptions:1. `calculate_average(scores: List[float])-> float`:-This function takes a list of scores as input and calculates their average.-Returns the average score as a float. 2. `sort_numbers(numbers: List[int])-> List[int]`:-This function takes a list of numbers as input and arranges them in ascending order.-Returns a new list with the sorted numbers. 3. `capitalize_string(s: str)-> str`:-This function takes a string as input and capitalizes the first letter of each word.-Returns the modified string.---### Class Descriptions:1. `User` class:-This class represents a user and stores their information such as name, age, and email.-It includes methods like `update_age(new_age: int)-> None` to update the user's age, and `__str__()-> str` to provide a string representation of the user object.-Example usage: ``` user = User('John Doe', 25,'johndoe@example.com') user.update_age(26) print(user) # Output: User: John Doe, Age: 26, Email: johndoe@example.com ``` 2. `Calculator` class:-This class represents a basic calculator with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.-It includes `add(a: int, b: int)-> int`, `subtract(a: int, b: int)-> int`, `multiply(a: int, b: int)-> int`, and `divide(a: int, b: int)-> float` methods.-Example usage: ``` calculator = Calculator() result = calculator.add(5, 3) print(result) # Output: 8 ```---The code script is structured to enhance code reusability and simplicity. It promotes the use of classes and functions for modular and organized development. Each function and class has a specialized role, increasing the overall efficiency of code execution. |
