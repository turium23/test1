## üìç Overview

The AutoDoc-ChatGPT project is an automated documentation tool aimed at generating code comments using a language model called ChatGPT. The project allows users to input a code file and a configuration file, then processes the code and generates comments for each part of the code. These comments are merged with the code, creating a commented version. The tool aims to save time and effort by automating the code documentation process, helping developers understand the codebase and improving collaboration.
