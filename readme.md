## üìç Overview

The AutoDoc-ChatGPT project is a code documentation tool that uses ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot. It generates comments for code snippets in various programming languages by dividing the code into parts, connecting to the chatbot API, and generating comments for each part. The resulting comments are then merged with the code, providing automated documentation.The core functionality of the project is to automate the process of generating code documentation. It analyzes the code, interacts with the chatbot API to generate comments, and inserts the generated comments as docstrings or block comments into the code. This saves time for developers and ensures consistent and informative documentation for the codebase.The purpose of the project is to simplify the task of code documentation by leveraging machine learning and natural language processing capabilities. It eliminates the manual effort involved in writing and maintaining code comments, allowing developers to focus more on the actual development process. The value proposition lies in improving code readability, enabling better code understanding and faster onboarding for new team members.

The "create_commented_file" method creates a new file with the commented content provided as an argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| prompt_commented.py    | This code snippet provides a class called `Prompt` that generates prompts for coding exercises in a specified language. It takes in the language, code, and example text as arguments and has a `create` method that generates the prompt by replacing placeholders in a template file with the given code and example text. It allows for the example text to be optional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| result_commented.py    | The provided code snippet defines a class called "Result" with a constructor that takes code, text comment, and language arguments. The class has a "get" method that modifies the code by including the text comments as docstrings for the appropriate class and function definitions in Python code. The "py" method in the class handles the modification of Python code by splitting the code into sections based on the text comment. It then replaces the specified text with the comments as docstrings. Above that, the code leverages regular expressions for finding and extracting the relevant portions of text and uses string manipulation to perform the modifications. The modified code is returned as a string. Overall, this functionality can be useful for automatically documenting code with associated comments. |
| settings_commented.py  | The code snippet defines a class called `Settings` that stores program settings. It includes a `supported_languages` variable, which is a list containing one element, "py".

| example_commented.ts   | The provided code snippet defines two classes: `Pizza` and `PizzaMaker`. The `Pizza` class represents a type of pizza and has properties for the name and toppings of the pizza. The `PizzaMaker` class provides a static method `create` that takes a pizza object as input and returns a new `Pizza` object with the same name and toppings. The code then uses the `PizzaMaker` class to create a pizza object named'Inferno' with toppings'cheese' and'peppers'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
