## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular architecture, with separate classes for user accounts, analytics, user inputs, database connections, etc. The use of classes promotes code reusability and separation of concerns. The system appears to be single-threaded and synchronous.
| **📖 Documentation**   | The codebase includes detailed documentation with summaries for each file, describing the purpose and functionality of its functions and classes. This documentation ensures that developers can easily understand and use the codebase. |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The codebase does not appear to have explicit external dependencies. However, there may be implicit dependencies on standard libraries and frameworks used by Python for functionalities such as string manipulations, mathematical calculations, and file system interactions. |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase is modular, with functions and classes organized into specific files to perform distinct tasks. This modularity allows for easy maintenance and debugging by isolating functionality in smaller, interchangeable components. |
| **✔️ Testing**          | The codebase does not include explicit testing strategies or tools. Further assessment of testing effectiveness requires review and analysis of testing files, if present.
| **⚡️ Performance**      | Based on the available information, it is not possible to analyze the system's performance. Specific performance improvements such as optimizing algorithms, reducing I/O operations, or implementing caching mechanisms cannot be determined without an in-depth code review and profiling.
| **🔐 Security**        | The codebase does not appear to have specific security measures. Further review is required to ascertain if the system has proper authentication, authorization, and input validation mechanisms to protect data and maintain functionality.
| **🔀 Version Control** | The codebase intelligently utilizes Git, providing a complete version control history. The use of Git enables collaborative development and facilitates easy identification and resolution of issues.
| **🔌 Integrations**    | The codebase does not explicitly mention any external system integrations. However, it may require integration with databases or other services to perform functionalities such as user management and analytics.
| **📶 Scalability**     | Based on the provided information, the scalability of the system cannot be fully assessed. Additional details about the system's intended scale, performance requirements, and infrastructure would be needed to determine its ability to handle growth.

This is a preliminary analysis based on the provided file and summary information. A deep code review and examination of the system's entire codebase would provide more accurate and comprehensive insights into each aspect mentioned above.

Code Script Summary

This code script is designed to provide functionality for managing user accounts and tracking various data related to each account. It includes several functions and classes, each serving a specific purpose.

---

'\n'#### Class: UserAccount

This class represents a user account and contains properties such as the username, password, email, and account type. The class also includes methods for setting and retrieving these properties, as well as for validating the account credentials.

---

'\n'#### Function: createAccount

This function takes user input for username, password, email, and account type, and creates a new UserAccount object with the provided information. It then adds the new account to the system and returns a success message.

---

'\n'#### Function: login

This function prompts the user to enter their username and password. It checks if the provided credentials match any of the existing user accounts and logs the user in if a match is found. It returns a success message upon successful login or an error message if the credentials are invalid.

---

'\n'#### Function: updateUserEmail

This function allows a logged-in user to update their account email. It prompts the user to enter the new email, validates its format, and updates the corresponding UserAccount object. It returns a success message upon successful update or an error message if the email format is invalid.

---

'\n'#### Function: deleteUserAccount

This function allows an administrator to delete a user account from the system. It prompts the administrator to enter the username of the account to be deleted and removes the corresponding UserAccount object from the system. It returns a success message upon successful deletion or an error message if the specified account does not exist.

---

'\n'#### Class: Analytics

This class provides analytics functionality related to user accounts. It includes methods for generating reports on the number of accounts by type, the most active users, and the average account age.

---

'\n'#### Function: generateTypeReport

This function generates a report on the number of accounts by their types (e.g., regular user, premium user, admin). It counts the accounts by type and returns the report as a formatted string.

---

'\n'#### Function: generateActiveUsersReport

This function generates a report on the most active users based on their recent activity. It analyzes user activity logs, calculates the activity scores based on criteria such as log frequency and duration, and returns the report with the most active users sorted in descending order.

---

'\n'#### Function: calculateAverageAccountAge

This function calculates the average age of user accounts based on their creation dates. It calculates the time elapsed since account creation for each UserAccount object and returns the average age as a formatted string.

Summary\n
The code script contains several functions and classes that are used for various tasks. These include functions for manipulating strings, performing mathematical calculations, manipulating data structures, and interacting with the file system. Additionally, there are classes for handling user input, managing database connections, and implementing specific algorithms.\n
---\n
#### Function-`manipulate_strings`\n
This function takes in a string as input and performs various manipulations on it. It includes operations such as removing whitespace, converting to uppercase, finding the index of a specific character, and counting the occurrence of a substring within the input string.\n
```python
def manipulate_strings(input_string): 
    # Implementation code
```
---\n
#### Function-`perform_calculation`\n
