## üìç Overview

This project appears to be a combination of automated code documentation generator and language model display tool. The main part transforms Python code into well-commented versions, utilizing OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate necessary comments, which can improve developers' understanding of unfamiliar code. Other parts describe various language models, illustrating their capabilities to construct different textual outputs. This integration can be invaluable in enhancing productivity in code writing, understanding, troubleshooting, and language model application in practical use-cases.

| [json_my.json](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/json_my.json)                       | This code consists of three parts defined by different keys: "t5-vicuna-3b", "camel-5b", and "mpt-7b". The script is telling the server about different models, displaying certain object details such as number of parameters, VRAM requirements, working URLs for finding images of objects, and source/dataset details. Another feature is generating responses using examples, providing text for different tasks like creating a travel blog or resignation letter. Lastly, it gives evaluation clip stats for benchmark comparisons.                                                                                                           |
| [t5_vicuna_3b.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/t5_vicuna_3b.py)                 | The provided code is a Python dictionary describing a model "T5 Vicuna". Characteristics include category, display name, various thumbnail URLs, parameters, VRAM levels, hub information, default configurations, and a detailed description. It provides an example of the model crafting a detailed travel blog post.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [main.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\main.py)                 | This Python code is designed to create automated documentation for provided Python files with the use of ChatGPT (provided authentication via a config file). It parses the input code file path from the console arguments, verifies its existence, loads its content, discerns the language, runs the AutoDoc program using these details, and outputs the documentation as comments in the code file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| [divider.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\divider.py)   | The provided code describes a class named "Divider" that splits a given text into segments based on a specified language setting. On class initialization, it takes a string of text and a language as input parameters. The'divide' function then uses these parameters to find starting and ending points for the segments, and appends those segments to a list. The function finally returns this list. If any errors occur during the process, the function still handles preserving segment fans staring from the last successful point up to the end of the text. The division settings for different languages are retrieved from'Settings'. |
| [file.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\file.py)         | This code defines a Python class, `File`, used for file handling. It stores a file's pathname, directory, filename and language (extension). The `content` method reads the file content. The `language` method returns the file's language. The `create_commented_file` method creates a new version of the file with added comments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [prompt.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\prompt.py)     | The provided code defines a Python class `Prompt`. This class models a language-specific text prompt from a provided text, employing file I/O operations. In its `create()` method, it generates a string by reading a specific language model file, replacing'CODE' placeholder in that file with the provided text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
