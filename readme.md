## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular architecture, with separate classes and functions for data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, data loading, model handling, report generation, and user interface. Components are well-defined and organized.                                                                                                                                        |
| **📖 Documentation**   | The codebase has comprehensive documentation, with detailed explanations of each function and class. The documentation enables users and developers to understand the purpose, inputs, and outputs of each component.                                                                                                                                           |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The codebase relies on external libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. However, the dependencies are minimal, and the codebase strives to use native Python functions and modules wherever possible for better maintainability and compatibility.                                                                                            |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase is highly modular, with well-defined classes and functions that encapsulate specific functionality. This modular approach makes the codebase flexible, reusable, and easy to maintain. The organization into smaller components allows for easier troubleshooting and extension of features.                                                                   |
| **✔️ Testing**          | Information about the system's testing strategies and tools is not available in the provided file summaries. Further analysis or project-specific information is required to evaluate the system's testing approach.                                                                                    |
| **⚡️ Performance**      | The codebase performance cannot be assessed based on the provided file summaries alone. Performance considerations depend on specific implementation details, data sizes, and the complexity of analysis and visualization tasks. In-depth profiling and benchmarking may be necessary to evaluate and optimize performance. |
| **🔐 Security**        | There is no explicit information about security measures in the provided file summaries. Proper security should be implemented based on project requirements, including user authentication, input validation, and secure handling of sensitive data.                                                                                            |
| **🔀 Version Control** | Git is used as the version control system for this codebase, allowing for efficient collaboration, code management, and tracking of project changes. Git facilitates maintaining different versions, branches, and collaboration among multiple developers, enhancing codebase stability and integrity.                                                                  |
| **🔌 Integrations**    | No specific information about system integrations is provided in the file summaries. Further analysis or project-specific details are needed to evaluate the system's interactions with other systems and services.                                                                                                               |
| **📶 Scalability**     | The codebase's scalability cannot be fully assessed without additional project-specific context. Factors like data volume, processing requirements, and architectural considerations influence scalability. A well-designed modular system can facilitate scalability with proper optimization and cloud infrastructure if needed.                               |
