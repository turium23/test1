## üìç Overview

The AutoDoc-ChatGPT project is a console application that utilizes the ChatGPT model to automatically generate code documentation. It takes a code file as input, processes it through the AutoDoc module, and generates commented documentation that is appended to the original code. The project's core purpose is to streamline the documentation process by automating the generation of descriptive comments, improving code readability, and reducing developer effort. This value proposition saves developers valuable time and ensures consistent and comprehensive code documentation.
