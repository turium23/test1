## üìç Overview

The project is a collection of code snippets and guidance on how to extract and print functions from Python scripts. It includes examples and explanations on using the'inspect' module and manually reading and copying function code. The core purpose of the project is to assist developers in understanding and visualizing the functions within a script. By providing these resources, the project adds value by simplifying the process of accessing function code for debugging, code analysis, or documentation purposes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The system follows a modular architecture with separate modules for AutoDoc functionality and chat conversation handling. The main.py file contains the chat conversation handling logic, while autodoc.py file handles the AutoDoc functions. The system is designed to be easily extendable and maintainable.   |
| **üìñ Documentation**   | The project provides some level of documentation in the form of comments within the code files, explaining how to print functions in a given script using the `inspect` module. However, there could be more comprehensive documentation, including usage instructions, configuration setups, and examples.   |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The project does not have any explicit external library dependencies. It relies on the built-in Python modules `inspect` for printing functions and `os.path` for file handling.   |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The system is organized into separate modules for different functionality, allowing for clearer separation of concerns. The main.py file handles chat conversation, while the autodoc.py file handles the AutoDoc functionality. This modularity makes it easier to develop and maintain the system.   |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**          | The project does not contain any explicit testing strategies or tools. Proper unit tests and test coverage implementation are required to ensure the quality and reliability of the codebase.   |
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**      | Performance is difficult to assess based solely on the codebase. However, the code for printing functions and handling conversations is generally lightweight and does not indicate any significant performance issues. Optimization in terms of memory usage and processing time can be further improved with profiling and performance testing techniques.   |
| **üîê Security**        | The codebase does not contain any obvious security measures except for basic file read operations. Considering the system's purpose, additional security measures or access controls should be implemented to protect sensitive or private information.   |
| **üîÄ Version Control** | The project is managed using Git, and the codebase is hosted on GitHub. The GitHub repository keeps track of the project's history, allowing for proper version control management and collaborative development.   |
| **üîå Integrations**    | The system does not have any explicit integrations with other systems or services. It can be further enhanced by integrating with external libraries or APIs to provide additional functionality or language understanding capabilities.   |
| **üì∂ Scalability**     | The current codebase does not indicate specific measures or considerations for scalability. Depending on the expected usage, future enhancements may involve optimizing code performance, implementing distributed systems, or horizontal scaling to handle increased workload or user growth.   |

| [main.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\main.py)               | As an AI language model, I can only provide general guidance on how to print functions in a script. To directly print the functions in a script, you can use the inspect module in Python. Here's an example:```pythonimport inspect# Define your functionsdef func1(): print("Function 1")def func2(): print("Function 2")# Print all functions in the scriptfunctions = inspect.getmembers(__main__, inspect.isfunction)for name, func in functions: print(name)```In the example above, we import the `inspect` module and then use the `getmembers` function along with the `isfunction` predicate to get a list of all functions defined in the current module (`__main__`). Finally, we iterate over the list of functions and print their names.Please note that this example assumes you're running the script directly as the main module. If you're working with a module that's imported by another script, you'll need to replace `__main__` with the appropriate module name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [autodoc.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\autodoc.py) | I'm sorry, but as an AI text model, I cannot directly execute or print functions from a given script. However, I can help you by providing guidance on how to extract and print the function code from a script.To print the functions in a Python script, you can follow these steps:1. Open the Python file in a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice.2. Look for function definitions in the file. Functions are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses, like `def function_name():`.3. Once you locate a function, read and copy the lines under it until you find the corresponding closing parenthesis that matches the opening parenthesis of the function definition.4. Paste the copied code and print it wherever you wish, such as in the console or another file.Here's an example code snippet demonstrating how you can implement this:```pythondef print_functions(script_file): with open(script_file,'r') as file: script_content = file.readlines() inside_function = False function_code = [] for line in script_content: if line.startswith('def'): inside_function = True if inside_function: function_code.append(line) if line.strip().endswith('):'): inside_function = False print("".join(function_code)) function_code = []# Usagescript_file_path ='path/to/your_script.py'print_functions(script_file_path)```Replace `'path/to/your_scrip |

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the project repository. This creates a copy of the project on your account that you can modify without affecting the original project.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using a Git client like Git or GitHub Desktop.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-feature-branch` or `bugfix-issue-123`).
```sh
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```
4. Make changes to the project's codebase.
5. Commit your changes to your local branch with a clear commit message that explains the changes you've made.
```sh
git commit -m 'Implemented new feature.'
```
6. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command
```sh
git push origin new-feature-branch
```
7. Create a new pull request to the original project repository. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made and why they're necessary.
The project maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback or merge them into the main branch.
