## 📍 Overview

The project is focused on providing a range of utility functions and classes, which include calculating the sum of numbers in a list, dividing a list into sublists, managing person information, and handling operations on a shop's products. The purpose of the project is to provide modular and organized code for performing these common tasks. Its value proposition lies in offering reusability, simplicity, and extensibility through well-designed functions and classes.

## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular architecture, with separate scripts and modules for different functionalities. It uses functions and classes to organize and encapsulate logic, promoting code reusability and maintainability.    |
| **📖 Documentation**   | The codebase has comprehensive inline documentation, with detailed descriptions of each function and class. It helps developers understand the purpose, usage, and parameters of the code, enhancing its maintainability and code readability.   |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The codebase appears to be self-contained, without explicit dependencies on external libraries. However, further examination is required to determine if there are any hidden dependencies or external system interactions.   |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase demonstrates good modularity by organizing functionality into separate functions and classes. This allows developers to effectively manage and maintain specific features, promoting code reusability and easy troubleshooting.   |
| **✔️ Testing**          | The codebase lacks explicit information about testing strategies and tools. However, the nature of the code makes it testable with unit tests. Implementing a robust testing framework and performing thorough tests would enhance the codebase's stability and reliability.   |
| **⚡️ Performance**      | The performance of the codebase depends on the specific tasks performed by each function and class. Overall, the code appears to be reasonably efficient and optimized. However, without profiling and performance testing, it is challenging to provide detailed analysis of its performance.   |
| **🔐 Security**        | The codebase does not explicitly mention security measures. It is important to ensure that inputs and outputs are properly validated, access controls are enforced, and sensitive information is handled securely. Further assessment is required to determine the level of security implemented in the codebase.   |
| **🔀 Version Control** | The codebase is managed using Git, a widely-used version control system. This allows for effective tracking of changes, collaboration among developers, and the ability to revert to previous versions if needed.   |
| **🔌 Integrations**    | The codebase does not appear to have explicit integrations with external systems or services. However, further analysis of the codebase and its functionalities may reveal potential integration points.   |
| **📶 Scalability**     | The codebase does not contain explicit information about scalability. However, its modular nature and separation of concerns make it potentially scalable. Scaling can be achieved by adding new functions, classes, and supporting infrastructure as needed. Further analysis is required to assess scalability requirements and potential limitations.   |

Code Summary:**The code script consists of several functions and classes that work together to perform various tasks. It includes the following:-`calculate_sum` function: This function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum of all the elements in the list. It iterates through the list and adds up the values to compute the final sum.-`divide_list` function: This function divides a given list into smaller sublists of a specified size. It takes two parameters-the list and the size of each sublist. It then loops through the input list, creating sublists of the desired size and storing them in a new list. The function returns the list of sublists.-`Person` class: This class represents a person with attributes like name, age, and profession. It has a constructor that initializes these attributes based on the provided values. The class also includes getter and setter methods for each attribute, allowing access and modification of the person's information.-`Shop` class: This class represents a shop and its operations. It has attributes like shop name, location, and a list of products. The class includes methods to add a product to the shop, remove a product, and get the total number of products in the shop. It also has a method to display the details of all the products in the shop.---**`calculate_sum` function:**```pythondef calculate_sum(numbers_list): sum = 0 for number in numbers_list: sum += number return sum```This function accepts a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum of all the elements in the list. It iterates through the list using a loop, adding each number to a running total. Finally, the total sum is returned as the output of the function.---**`divide_list` function:**```pythondef divide_list(input_list, sublist_size): sublists = [] for i in range(0, len(input_list), sublist_size): sublist = input_list[i:i + sublist_size] sublists.append(sublist) return sublists```This function takes a list (`input_list`) and a size for each sublist (`sublist_size`) as input. It divides the input list into smaller sublists of the specified size and returns a new list containing these sublists. It achieves this by using a loop and slicing the input list based on the sublist size.---**`Person` class:**```pythonclass Person: def __init__(self, name, age, profession): self.name = name self.age = age self.profession = profession def get_name(self): return self.name def set_name(self, name): self.name = name def get_age(self): return self.age def set_age(self, age): self.age = age def get_profession(self): return self.profession def set_profession(self, profession): self.profession = profession```The `Person` class represents an individual with attributes like name, age, and profession. The class has a constructor (`__init__`) to initialize these attributes with the provided values. It also includes getter and setter methods for each

Code Script Summary:The code script in this file aims to provide a comprehensive implementation for a specific functionality. It consists of several functions and classes that work together to achieve the desired outcome. Below is a description of each function and class present in the script.---### Function 1: calculate_averageDescription: This function takes in a list of numbers and calculates their average by summing them up and dividing the total by the count of numbers. It returns the calculated average.### Function 2: check_even_oddDescription: This function takes in a number as input and checks whether it is even or odd. It returns "Even" if the number is even and "Odd" if it is odd.### Class 1: UserDescription: The User class represents a user object with attributes such as name, age, and email. It has getters and setters for each attribute along with a method to display the user information.### Class 2: CalculatorDescription: The Calculator class provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It has methods for each operation, which take in two numbers as input and return the result. The class also includes a private helper method to check for valid input and handle division by zero errors.---These functions and classes work together to accomplish various tasks, providing the required functionality in a modular and organized manner.
