## üìç Overview

The AutoDoc-ChatGPT project is a console application designed to generate code documentation using ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot. It takes a code file as input and uses the AutoDoc module to generate comments for each part of the code. These comments are then merged back into the code file. The project's core functionality lies in automating the documentation process, saving developers valuable time and effort while enhancing code comprehension and maintainability. It provides a valuable proposition by leveraging AI technology to generate informative comments directly within the codebase.
