## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular architecture with separate modules for different functionalities like task management, database operations, API interactions, and calculations. The main.py script acts as an entry point and orchestrates the task management process. Overall, the architecture is well-organized and promotes code reusability. |
| **📖 Documentation**   | The codebase includes comprehensive and well-structured documentation. Each file has a summary explaining its purpose, functions, classes, and their respective roles. The documentation helps developers understand the codebase quickly and facilitate maintainability. |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The codebase does not have any external dependencies. It primarily relies on built-in Python libraries and does not require additional installations. This reduces the complexity and potential security risks associated with third-party dependencies. |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | Modules in the codebase have a clear separation of concerns, allowing for independent development and reuse. The main.py script acts as an interface while other files represent specific functionalities like task management, database operations, API interactions, and calculations. This modular structure simplifies maintenance and future enhancements. |
| **✔️ Testing**          | No information is available about testing strategies or tools used in the codebase. However, comprehensive unit testing to cover all functionalities would greatly enhance stability and longevity. |
| **⚡️ Performance**      | Performance is difficult to evaluate without specific performance benchmarks or insights into the expected workload. However, the codebase leverages built-in Python libraries and follows efficient programming practices. With its current design, it should perform well for managing personal task lists. |
| **🔐 Security**        | The codebase does not cover specific security measures. Additional measures, such as input validation and authentication, would be essential to secure sensitive data.

It includes various functions and classes to handle user input, add and remove tasks, tag tasks, and prioritize tasks based on their due dates.---## Function: getInput(prompt)This function prompts the user for input using the given prompt message and returns the user's input as a string.---## Function: addTask(taskName, dueDate)This function takes a task name and a due date as parameters and adds a new task to the user's task list. The task is stored as a dictionary with properties such as name, due date, and priority.---## Function: removeTask(taskName)This function takes a task name as a parameter and removes the corresponding task from the user's task list.---## Class: TaskThis class represents a single task in the task list. It has properties such as name, due date, priority, and tags. Users can create a task object by specifying its properties during instantiation.---## Class: TaskListThis class represents the user's task list. It has methods for adding a new task, removing a task, and displaying the task list. The task list is stored as a list of Task objects.---## Class: TaskManagerThis class is responsible for handling user input and managing the overall task management process. It has methods for displaying menu options, processing user commands, and interacting with the TaskList object.---## Function: main()This function is the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of the TaskManager class and starts the task management process by calling its run() method.---                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the project repository. This creates a copy of the project on your account that you can modify without affecting the original project.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using a Git client like Git or GitHub Desktop.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-feature-branch` or `bugfix-issue-123`).
```sh
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```
4. Make changes to the project's codebase.
5. Commit your changes to your local branch with a clear commit message that explains the changes you've made.
```sh
git commit -m 'Implemented new feature.'
```
6. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command
```sh
git push origin new-feature-branch
```
7. Create a new pull request to the original project repository. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made and why they're necessary.
The project maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback or merge them into the main branch.
