## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The system follows a modular design with separate modules for different functionalities such as calculations of numbers, rectangles, and circles. Each module has well-defined functions or classes, promoting code reusability and maintainability. |
| **📖 Documentation**   | The documentation is comprehensive, providing descriptions of each function and class's purpose and functionality. It aids in understanding the codebase and facilitates future development and maintenance. |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | There are no external dependencies in the codebase. The system is self-contained and does not rely on any external libraries or systems for its core functionalities. |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase is well-organized and modular, making it easy to understand and maintain. Each module serves a specific purpose, and the functions or classes within the modules are cohesive and have single responsibilities. |
| **✔️ Testing**          | No information is available regarding the system's testing strategies and tools. It is important to ensure thorough testing of the codebase to ensure functionality and prevent regressions. |
| **⚡️ Performance**      | Based on the available information, it is not possible to evaluate the system's performance characteristics regarding speed, efficiency, and resource usage. Additional performance analysis would be necessary. |
| **🔐 Security**        | No explicit measures for security are mentioned in the available information about the codebase. Adequate security measures should be implemented, considering aspects such as input validation, data encryption, and protection against common security vulnerabilities. |
| **🔀 Version Control** | The codebase is maintained using Git, as evident from the provided repository link. Git facilitates version control, allowing for collaboration, branching, and merging of code changes. Proper usage of version control helps track and manage code changes, facilitating teamwork and rollback if needed. |
| **🔌 Integrations**    | No explicit information about integrations with other systems or services is available in the codebase. Integration points, API usage, or inter-service communication details are not mentioned in the provided information. |
| **📶 Scalability**     | The scalability aspect of the codebase cannot be assessed without more information. Scalability is important to handle increasing loads, both in terms of user interactions and data processing. Taking into account potential future requirements and designing for scalability can prevent performance bottlenecks as the system grows. |

This code script is aimed at implementing various functions and classes for a specific purpose. The script contains the following functions and classes:1. **Function calculate_average(numbers):** This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average value of those numbers. It calculates the sum of all numbers and divides it by the total count of numbers. The resulting average is then returned.2. **Function find_factorial(n):** This function calculates and returns the factorial of a given number'n'. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to'n'. The function uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to'n' and multiply each iteration result with the running product.3. **Class Rectangle:** This class represents a rectangle shape and has various methods for manipulating and obtaining information about the rectangle. The class constructor takes the length and width of the rectangle as parameters. The class contains the following methods:-**Method calculate_area():** calculates and returns the area of the rectangle by multiplying its length and width.-**Method calculate_perimeter():** calculates and returns the perimeter of the rectangle by adding its length and width and then multiplying the sum by 2.4. **Class Circle:** This class represents a circle shape and provides methods for performing various calculations on a circle. The class constructor takes the radius of the circle as a parameter. The class contains the following methods:-**Method calculate_area():** calculates and returns the area of the circle using the formula π * radius^2, where π is a mathematical constant.-**Method calculate_circumference():** calculates and returns the circumference of the circle using the formula 2 * π * radius.This code script provides a comprehensive set of functions and classes for performing calculations related to numbers, rectangles, and circles.
