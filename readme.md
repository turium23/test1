## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular architecture, with separate files for different functionalities (student database and task management). The use of classes enhances code reusability and separation of concerns. The code structure is easy to understand and maintain.                                              |
| **📖 Documentation**   | The codebase comes with descriptive comments that explain the purpose and functionality of different functions and classes. However, the documentation could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of the code logic and the interaction between modules.                         |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The codebase does not have any external dependencies, making it self-contained.                                                                                              |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase is structured into smaller modules for managing student data and tasks, promoting code reusability and maintainability. The separation of concerns allows for easy updates and modifications in specific areas of the codebase.                                                                    |
| **✔️ Testing**          | There is no mention of testing strategies or tools in the codebase. Implementing unit tests can help ensure the correctness and reliability of the code.                                                                                             |
| **⚡️ Performance**      | Without specific performance measurements or benchmarks, it is difficult to evaluate the system's performance accurately. However, the codebase appears to be designed efficiently, with operations performed on student records and tasks achieving good runtime complexity.                               |
| **🔐 Security**        | The codebase does not implement any specific security measures. Depending on the specific use case, additional security measures such as input validation, user authentication, and data encryption may need to be implemented to protect data and ensure system integrity. |
| **🔀 Version Control** | The codebase uses Git for version control, as indicated by the repository URL. Git allows for efficient collaboration, code versioning, and easy reverting of changes, making it a good choice for managing the codebase.                                                                                             |
| **🔌 Integrations**    | The codebase does not have any explicit integrations with other systems or services. Depending on the requirements, integrations with databases, external APIs for data access, or deployment platforms could be added.                                                                       |
| **📶 Scalability**     | The codebase's modularity and use of classes make it adaptable and scalable. It can easily accommodate additions or modifications to existing functionality. However, the codebase might need enhancements to handle larger datasets efficiently, such as database optimization and indexing.                            |

It provides a set of functions and classes to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on tasks.1. Task Class:-The Task class represents a single task and stores the task's details such as title, description, and status.-It has properties to get and set the task's attributes.-The class defines methods for converting the task data to a dictionary (for serialization) and for re-constructing a task object from a dictionary.2. TaskManager Class:-The TaskManager class serves as the main interface for managing tasks.-It contains a list to store all the tasks and provides methods to manipulate the task list.-The class has methods to add a new task, retrieve a task by ID, update a task's attributes, delete a task, and find tasks based on specific criteria.3. save_tasks() Function:-The save_tasks() function is used to serialize the task list and save it to a data file.-It takes the task list as parameter and writes the serialized data to a file named "tasks.json".4. load_tasks() Function:-The load_tasks() function is responsible for loading the task data from the data file and deserializing it into a list of Task objects.-It reads the contents of the "tasks.json" file and returns the deserialized task list.5. display_menu() Function:-The display_menu() function displays a menu of options for the user to interact with the task management system.-It prompts the user to select an option and returns the chosen option.6. add_task() Function:-The add_task() function prompts the user to provide the details of a new task (title, description, status) and creates a Task object.-It then adds the new task to the task list in the TaskManager.7. show_task() Function:-The show_task() function takes a task ID as input and retrieves the corresponding task from the TaskManager.-It displays the details of the task to the user.8. update_task() Function:-The update_task() function allows the user to update attributes (title, description, status) of a specific task.-It prompts the user to select the task to update by its ID and then asks for the new attribute values.9. delete_task() Function:-The delete_task() function deletes a task from the TaskManager based on its ID.-It prompts the user to choose the task to delete and removes it from the task list.These functions and classes work together to provide a basic task management system with operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. |
