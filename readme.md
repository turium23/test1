| [json_my.json](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/json_my.json)                       | The provided code implements information and evaluation metrics about different models in a structured JSON format. The details include model characteristics (name, parameters, VRAM usage, etc.), source links for image representation, usage instructions and performance specifications (acre, helaswag, mmlu, truthfulqa, etc.), and an overall average score for each individual model. Upon each model entity, there are additional components that contain requirements of certain tasks carried out by the respective models. |
| [t5_vicuna_3b.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/t5_vicuna_3b.py)                 | The code snippet represents a dictionary containing information about a machine learning model named "T5 Vicuna". It details components like its category, display name, applicable images (thumbnails), VRAM requirements, deployment parameters, location on the server (hub), the default configuration file, a brief description, and an illustrative usage with example output.                                                                                                                                                    |
| [main.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\main.py)                 | The code builds a console application which utilizes ChatGPT to automatically generate documentation for code. It currently supports Python language. The file path for which documentation is needed is provided as an argument from the console. After verification, it fetches file content and language, and passes it to AutoDoc. The resulting documentation is then added to the original file.                                                                                                                                  |

| [divider.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\divider.py)   | The provided code defines a Python class, "Divider". The class has a method "divide" that takes a given text (two publicly accessible custom settings defined the starting and ending markers) and the given language, it divides the content into smaller components based on starting and ending delimiters. In simpler terms, it provides chunked content for further processing, if exceptions occur it still continues executing.                                                                                                  |
| [file.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\file.py)         | The provided Python code defines a File class. This class assists in managing a file, obtaining its content and creating a commented file. It stores the absolute path, directory name, base file name, and file's programming language. The'content' function retrieves and reads the file content while'language' ascertains its programming language. With'create_commented_file', it generates a commented version of a file.                                                                                                       |
| [prompt.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\prompt.py)     | The code defines a class "Prompt" with two private attributes:'text' and'language'. The'create' method reads from a file named as the given language under'models' directory, then replaces the first occurrence of "CODE" in the file content with the provided'text' and returns the modified string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| [settings.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\settings.py) | The code sets up color coding and format styles using the'colorama' Python package. It also creates a'Settings' class for managing code snippets in Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript. This class defines which circumstances (reflecting specific syntax patterns) will trigger a sectional system divide in the various languages.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
