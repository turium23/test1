Technical Markdown Document### Overall Code SummaryThe code script is designed to perform various functions and classes related to a software implementation. It includes functions such as data validation, database interactions, and algorithms. Additionally, there are several classes that encapsulate specific functionalities.
### Function Descriptions**1. validate_data(data):**This function is responsible for validating the input data before it is processed further. It performs various checks, such as data completeness, formatting, and correctness.-Input: `data`-the input data to be validated.-Output: None.**2. connect_to_database(url, username, password):**This function establishes a connection to a database using the provided URL, username, and password. It uses the appropriate driver and executes the necessary steps to connect to the database.-Inputs:-`url`-the URL of the database.-`username`-the username required for authentication.-`password`-the password required for authentication.-Output: None.**3. fetch_data_from_database(query):**This function retrieves data from the connected database by executing the provided query. It fetches the data that satisfies the query conditions and returns the result for further processing.-Input: `query`-the SQL query to be executed.-Output: The result of the database query execution.**4. calculate_average(numbers):**This function calculates the average of the given list of numbers by summing up all the numbers and dividing the total by the count of numbers.-Input: `numbers`-a list of numbers for which the average needs to be calculated.-Output: The calculated average.### Class Descriptions**1. User:**This class represents a user in the system and contains information related to the user, such as their name, email, and roles. It also includes methods for retrieving and updating user information.-Methods:-`get_name()`-retrieves the name of the user.-`get_email()`-retrieves the email of the user.-`get_roles()`-retrieves the roles of the user.-`update_email(new_email)`-updates the email of the user with `new_email`.-`update_roles(new_roles)`-updates the roles of the user with `new_roles`.**2. Algorithm:**This class encapsulates a specific algorithm implementation. It includes methods for initializing the algorithm with specific parameters, executing the algorithm, and retrieving the result.-Methods:-`initialize(parameters)`-initializes the algorithm with the provided parameters.-`execute()`-executes the algorithm.-`get_result()`-retrieves the result of the executed algorithm.These are the main functions and classes in the code script. Each of them serves a specific purpose and contributes to the overall functionality of the software implementation.
