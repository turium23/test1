## üìç Overview

The AutoDoc project is a console application that aims to automate code documentation generation using ChatGPT. It takes a code file as input, divides it into parts, and sends each part to a ChatGPT model to generate comments. These comments are then merged with the original code, resulting in commented documentation. This automation saves time and effort for developers by eliminating the need for manual documentation and enhances the overall code understanding for future maintenance and collaboration purposes.
