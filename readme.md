## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular architecture with functions and classes organized in separate modules. The use of inheritance in the Employee and Student classes indicates a well-structured object-oriented design.    |
| **📖 Documentation**   | The code's documentation is thorough and provides detailed descriptions of each function and class, including their purpose, input parameters, and return values. The documentation enhances code readability and supports ease of maintenance and collaboration.    |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The codebase does not appear to rely on any external libraries or systems, limiting its dependencies and facilitating code portability and maintenance.     |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase is structured into smaller, independent components like functions and classes, which can be reused or modified without impacting the entire system. This modularity enhances code maintainability, extensibility, and testability.    |
| **✔️ Testing**          | The codebase does not appear to have any specific testing strategies or tools mentioned in the documentation. It is recommended to incorporate test frameworks like unit testing or integration testing to ensure code correctness and stability.    |
| **⚡️ Performance**      | Performance is not explicitly emphasized in the codebase documentation. However, certain aspects like optimized algorithms for functions could suggest a focus on efficiency. It is essential to benchmark and profile the codebase to identify and address any performance bottlenecks.    |
| **🔐 Security**        | The codebase does not appear to explicitly mention security measures. It is crucial to consider input validation, secure data handling, and proper access control to protect sensitive data and maintain system integrity.    |
| **🔀 Version Control** | The codebase is hosted on GitHub, indicating the use of Git for version control. Utilizing version control would facilitate collaboration, change tracking, and the ability to revert to previous versions if needed.    |
| **🔌 Integrations**    | The codebase does not demonstrate any explicit integrations with other systems or services. However, being modular in design could facilitate easy integration with external libraries or systems in the future.    |
| **📶 Scalability**     | The codebase does not explicitly mention scalability. By adhering to modular design principles, the codebase could potentially accommodate future scalability requirements by incorporating additional functionality or increasing data processing capacity.    |
