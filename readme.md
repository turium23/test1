| [autodoc.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\autodoc.py) | Code Script Summary**The code script consists of several functions and classes aimed at achieving a specific task. These include:1. **getDataFromAPI**: This function is responsible for fetching data from an external API. It takes an endpoint parameter and returns the data obtained from the API response. 2. **parseData**: This function parses the data obtained from the API response. It takes the raw data as input and returns a parsed object containing the relevant information. 3. **calculateStatistics**: This function calculates various statistics based on the parsed data. It takes the parsed object as input and calculates statistics such as average, minimum, and maximum values. The calculated statistics are returned in a formatted string.4. **plotGraph**: This function plots a graph based on the parsed data. It takes the parsed object as input and utilizes a data visualization library to create a graphical representation of the data. The resulting graph is displayed or saved to a file.5. **DataObject**: This class represents a data object obtained from the API response. It has attributes such as timestamp, value, and category. The class also includes methods for accessing and manipulating these attributes.---**Function: getDataFromAPI**```pythondef getDataFromAPI(endpoint): """Fetches data from an external API. Args: endpoint: A string representing the API endpoint. Returns: The data obtained from the API response. """ # API request logic here ```---**Function: parseData**```pythondef parseData(raw_data): """Parses the data obtained from the API response. Args: raw_data: The data obtained from the API response.
