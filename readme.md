| [t5_vicuna_3b.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/t5_vicuna_3b.py)                 | The provided code is a Python dictionary containing metadata for a model named'T5 Vicuna'. This includes categories, thumbnails at different resolutions, parameters, variant VRAM usage, related hubs, default configuration, model description, and a text generation example. The dataset is curated by LMSYS in Vicuna style and fine-tuned on ShareGPT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [main.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\main.py)                 | The code imports necessary modules and establishes authentication to ChatGPT using information in a'config.ini'. It creates a CLI tool, AutoDoc, that takes a file serve as an input via the "-file" argument. If the provided file doesn't exist, the program terminate with error message. Provided files are used to generate code documentation using ChatGPT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [autodoc.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\autodoc.py)   | This code snippet defines a class, `AutoDoc`, used to generate documentation for a given piece of code in a specific language. It first validates the input, before dividing the code into segments and forwards each to the GPT-based chatbot for generation of comments. The newly minted comments are then inserted back into the original code, resulting in a fully commented version of the original code.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [divider.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\divider.py)   | The provided code constructs a Divider class; the purpose of this class is to segment a stored string `'text'` using specific start and end delimiters for a provided `'language'`. These delimiters are found in an imported module. The'divide' function implements the segmentation: it creates a list of strings (termed `__splitted_content`) that denotes regions of text between cursor markers positioned using regular expressions. A try-except block assures that the function navigates safely around corners where fragmentation conditions fail. Segmented results are return in list format. |
| [file.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\file.py)         | The provided code defines a class named'File'. This class processes file data such as validating and extracting the absolute file path, basename and file extension (interpreted as language here). It can also read a file's content, return the language of code, and create a new file with additional content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [prompt.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\prompt.py)     | The provided Python class, Prompt, has two private variables,'text' and'language'. The'__init__' method initializes these variables. The'create' method generates a string by reading a text file specific to the language set, replaces "CODE" in the file's content with the stored text, and returns it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [result.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\result.py)     | This code defines a class "Result". It parses blocks of code written in Python or Typescript/Javascript that require commenting based on inputs provided. Given the code and textual comments with certain variabilities, it identifies relevant substrings, handles language-specific syntax and wraps them into generated blocks of comments inline in the provided code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [settings.py](https://github.com/turium23/test1/blob/main/AutoDoc-ChatGPT\modules\settings.py) | The code defines constant colors for terminal text outputs, and the functionality related to settings of code written in Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript. The'Settings' class stores the languages supported and regular expressions to extract classes, defs, types etc., marking the starting and ending points in code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
