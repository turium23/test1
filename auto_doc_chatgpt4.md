## üìç Overview

The project is a command-line tool for generating code documentation using an AI-powered chatbot. It can automatically generate comments for code in Python and TypeScript/JavaScript files by parsing the code and connecting to the chatbot API to generate comments for each code segment. The resulting commented code is returned, providing developers with an efficient way to document their code and improve code readability. The tool optimizes the code documentation process by leveraging advanced AI capabilities, saving developers time and effort.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The system follows a modular architecture with separate classes for different functionalities. The `AutoDoc` class interacts with other modules like `Divider`, `File`, `Prompt`, and `Result` to generate code documentation using an AI-powered chatbot. The codebase also includes a `Settings` module for language-specific settings. Overall, the architecture facilitates code separation and reusability.    |
| **üìñ Documentation**   | The codebase includes comments and docstrings that provide explanations and descriptions of various functionality and classes. It explains the purpose and usage of each file/module, making it easier for developers to understand the codebase. However, the documentation could be improved by including more detailed explanations and examples.    |
|**üîó Dependencies**    | The system relies on the `colorama` library for defining color and style constants in the `settings.py` module. It also leverages the external AI-powered chatbot for generating code comments. Additionally, it depends on common libraries like regular expressions and file I/O for various functionalities.    |
|**üß© Modularity**      | The system is well-organized into smaller interchangeable components represented by individual classes/modules like `AutoDoc`, `Divider`, `File`, `Prompt`, `Result`, and `Settings`. Each component has a specific responsibility and can be easily extended or modified without impacting the entire system. This modular design promotes maintainability and testability.    |
|**‚úîÔ∏è Testing**          | The codebase does not explicitly mention a testing strategy or provide dedicated tests. Incorporating a testing framework such as `pytest` and adding unit tests would help ensure the correctness and reliability of the system's functionality. |
|**‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**      | Based on the provided information, it is challenging to analyze the system's performance characteristics comprehensively. Performance can vary depending on the size and complexity of the code files being processed, the external chatbot API's response time, and other factors. To assess performance accurately, benchmarking and profiling techniques could be applied. Efficiency tuning might be possible by optimizing code splitting algorithm in the `Divider` module or parallelizing certain operations if applicable.   |
|**üîê Security**        | The codebase lacks specific security measures and does not mention any implementation for securing data and maintaining functionality. Depending on the environment and usage scenario, potential security risks may include unauthorized access to code/content, confidential information exposure/display, and secure creditentials handling when working with external services. Specific security practices such as input validation, authentication, secure communication, and access controls should be considered and implemented when deploying the codebase.    |
|**üîÄ Version Control** | The codebase is version controlled using Git, as evident from the given local file path. However, the Git repository details or actual version control practices (such as branching strategies, pull request review process) are not provided. A structured and organized version control workflow, using practices like feature branching, code reviews, and continuous integration, could improve collaboration, code stability, and prevent unintentional errors.   |
|**üîå Integrations**    | The system relies on external integration with an AI-powered chatbot for generating code
